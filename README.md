# ReciprocalBLAST
# Language: Python
# Input: TXT
# Output: TXT
# Tested with: PluMA 1.1, Python 3.6

PluMA plugin to take two output files generated by BLAST (Altschul et al, 1990)
and run ReciprocalBLAST (Ward, 2014) to calculate orthologs/paralogs between
two genomes.

The plugin accepts as input a parameters file of tab-delimited keyword-value pairs:
infile1: First result of BLAST
infile2: Second result of BLAST

(Note: If infile1 is the result of running BLAST on genome B against database A,
infile2 will most often be the reverse)

Ortholog pairs, or those that were present in the result of both BLAST executions,
will be sent to the output file in plain txt (TXT) format.
